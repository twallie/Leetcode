# TypeScript Instructions
You can use the standard `tsc filename.ts` then `node filename.js` to run the compiled TypeScript, but I prefer using the `ts-node` package from npx.
To use ts-node on a given TypeScript solution, type `npx ts-node 0001/solution.ts` to compile the whole thing a run with node, without any need for cleaning up.

# Python Instructions
Nothing fancy for Python, just use `python3 0001/solution.py` to run.
